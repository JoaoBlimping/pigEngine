Move the item loading functors back to assets because they rely on assets and also they
are not necessarily essential to the original item's type and that.
 - maps will be loaded as needed.
 - tilesets are managed
 
Geany is still making backup files when I don't want it to, I'll have to fix that. Also
If I can get a terminal emulator that runs in this window that would be pretty cool cos
then I can run everything from inside this pretty much.

Ok so now that the scripting language has been implemented, alhtough not integrated, it's
time to get back to the real engine. the first thing to do it make the overworld scene
appear, then we add characters, control them with a gamepad or keyboard, and also the
npc characters must be controlled also.
Then it's time to integrate the scripting language.
