Ok this time the makefile is genuinely fixed, it has like directories in the bin folder
now, which makes no difference to me whatsoever.
Now it's time to get back to switching the thing managers over to a single manager class.

I reckon this assets system will be much better, but my makefile is still mucking up,
it's going to be much nicer when it actually works. Ok i'm pretty sure it works now.
Ok, I've made a mad new system where all of the managers are the same class which I should
have done in the beginning. oh yeah the makefile still doesn't totally work so have fun
with that future self. It kinda works but all the files in subdirectories are built from
source each time and never become bytecode.

Working on the Level class which the OverworldScene class makes use of. Now i'm changing
the assets system so that I just have a global access point to all assets. It's probably
a little dodgy but I think it will also make things more simple and it worked well enough
for me in crazybone and the tap that leaked and leaked.

Adding OverworldScene class which is where the overworld part of the game will
take place.
