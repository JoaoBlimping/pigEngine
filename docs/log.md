Working on the Level class which the OverworldScene class makes use of. Now i'm changing
the assets system so that I just have a global access point to all assets. It's probably
a little dodgy but I think it will also make things more simple and it worked well enough
for me in crazybone and the tap that leaked and leaked.

Adding OverworldScene class which is where the overworld part of the game will
take place.
