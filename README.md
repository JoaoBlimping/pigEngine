# pigEngine
a game engine written in c++ and converted to html5 stuff with emscripten.

`You'd better strap your dick on, boy, because this is going to be one hell of
a game engine.`

This is going to be an engine for jrpg type games, except the battles will be like
fighting game battles.

Dependancies:
 - pigScript
 - danylib

you'll have to set the path to these projects's src folders in the Makefile
